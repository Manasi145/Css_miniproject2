Spotify UI Clone
Project Overview
This project is a static front-end clone of the Spotify web player user interface, built purely with HTML and CSS. The goal was to meticulously recreate Spotify's sleek design, focusing on layout, styling, and responsiveness, without implementing any JavaScript functionality for music playback or dynamic interactions.

Features
Responsive Design: Adapts to various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
Pixel-Perfect UI: Aims to replicate the visual elements of the Spotify web player as accurately as possible.
Static Content: Displays a fixed set of album covers, playlists, and navigation elements.
Clean & Organized Code: Well-commented and structured HTML and CSS for easy understanding and maintenance.
Technologies Used
HTML5: For the core structure and content.
CSS3: For all styling, layout, and visual presentation.

Integrate basic JavaScript for play/pause functionality (static audio files).
Add dynamic content loading.
Implement search functionality.
Improve accessibility features.
